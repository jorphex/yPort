### yPort
Discord and Telegram bots that help Yearn users monitor their Yearn Vault deposits across multiple addresses by generating detailed portfolio reports including personalized vault and staking suggestions based on users' current Vault deposits.

The bots do not require users to connect their wallets or interact with the blockchain. It simply reports on existing Vaults and provides information based on publicly available Vault data.

### Telegram
Start by sending your addresses or ENS names separated by spaces.

The bot is available for public use on Telegram here: [@yPort](https://t.me/yPortBot)
### Discord
Start by sending your addresses or ENS names to the bot by DM. Send /yport in the specified channel to request a report at any time. To ensure privacy, these report messages are sent using Discord ephemeral messages feature, meaning only the user that triggers the command will see the individual requested report in the public channel. The bot also sends a public report containing the top five single-asset vaults by APR, while also deleting the previous report to avoid flooding the channel. 

The bot is available for public use in the Yearn Discord here: [#yPort](https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/1279431421760507976)
