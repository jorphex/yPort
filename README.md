yPort is a Telegram bot that helps you track your deposits in Yearn Vaults.

✨ Start by sending /start, then submit your addresses or ENS names when prompted. The bot will process your addresses and send an immediate report. You’ll also receive daily reports at 00:00 UTC. You can request a report anytime using /yport. Seven-day and thirty-day yield estimates are included in the reports. Along with the report, the bot also sends vault suggestions with higher APRs of at least 3%, if available, based on the underlying assets of your current Vault deposits.

⏳ To reduce unnecessary API requests, please avoid spamming /yport.

The bot is available for public use here: [@yPort](https://t.me/yPortBot)
