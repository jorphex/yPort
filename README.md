yPort is a Telegram bot that helps you track your deposits in Yearn Vaults.

✨ Start by sending /start, then submit your EOAs when prompted. The bot will process your addresses and send an immediate report. You’ll also receive daily reports at 00:00 UTC, and you can request an updated report anytime using /report. A seven-day history is tracked for 1D and 7D changes in APRs and USD values.

⏳ To reduce unnecessary API requests, please avoid spamming /report.

The bot is available for public use here: [@yPort](https://t.me/yPortBot)
